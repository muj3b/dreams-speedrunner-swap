## 📝 Commands

| Command | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `/swap gui` | Opens the full management hub (mode selector, team setup, settings, task pool, stats, kits, etc.). |
| `/swap start` · `/swap stop` · `/swap pause` · `/swap resume` · `/swap status` | Runtime controls for starting, stopping, pausing and inspecting the current match. |

## ⚙️ Configuration & GUI Coverage

The plugin ships with a comprehensive `config.yml`, but every option can be adjusted from the in-game GUI. Here’s how the configuration maps to the menu structure:

| GUI Section | Key Config Areas | Highlights |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **⚙️ Swap & Timing** | `swap.*` | Interval, randomisation, experimental limits, jitter, grace period, hunter swap, hot potato, preserve runner progress. |
| **🛡️ Safety & Freeze** | `safe_swap.*`, `freeze_mode`, `freeze_mechanic.*`, `cancel.*`, `single_player_sleep`, `spawn.*`, `limbo.*` | Safe-swap radii, freeze mechanics, spawn handling, limbo/spawn location setters. |
| **🎯 Hunter Tools** | `tracker.*` | Compass enable/disable, update ticks, compass jamming duration & distance. |
| **🧪 Power-ups** | `power_ups.*` | Toggle system, choose positive/negative effects, duration & level ranges. |
| **🌍 World Border** | `world_border.*` | Enable shrink, starting/ending size, shrink duration, warning distance/interval. |
| **🏹 Bounty System** | `bounty.*` | Master toggle, cooldown, glow length, reward durations, manual assign/clear. |
| **🛡 Last Stand & Sudden Death** | `last_stand.*`, `sudden_death.*` | Configure runner clutch buffs and sudden-death arena, timers, and effects. |
| **📊 Statistics & UI** | `stats.*`, `ui.update_ticks.*`, `timer_visibility.*` | Enable tracking, broadcast cadence, timer visibility, action bar/title update rates. |
| **✨ Particle Trail** | `particle_trail.*` | Toggle runner particle trail, tick interval, particle id, and RGB colour (new GUI controls). |
| **🎙 Voice Chat** | `voice_chat.*` | Simple Voice Chat integration toggles. |
| **🎒 Kits** | `kits.*` & `kits.yml` | Enable runner/hunter kits and quick testing buttons. |
| **🎯 Task Master** | `task_manager.*` | Pause behaviour, reconnection grace, max duration, include defaults, difficulty filter, per-task enable/disable, custom task creator, task pool management, assignments viewer. |

> 📝 **Tip:** Use `/swap gui` (or the `/swap` hotkey in the tab completions) to reach any of these menus instantly—every slider, toggle, and button writes back to `config.yml` (or `tasks.yml` / `kits.yml`) for persistence.

---

## 🎨 Creating & Managing Custom Tasks

### GUI Workflow
1. Open `/swap gui` → **Task Master**.
2. **Custom Tasks** lets you add new objectives (ID + description) and remove existing ones.
3. **Task Pool** provides page-based toggles to enable/disable any built-in or custom task, adjust the difficulty filter, and reload `tasks.yml` live.

### Command Workflow
- `/swap tasks list` – review all definitions.
- `/swap tasks enable|disable <id>` – quick toggles from console or chat.
- `/swap tasks difficulty <easy|medium|hard>` – change the pool filter.
- `/swap tasks reroll` – reassign secret tasks prior to a round.
- `/swap tasks reload` – re-read `tasks.yml` after editing.

### Design Tips
- Aim for goals that take 10–30 minutes so races stay competitive.
- Use exact numbers (e.g. *collect 32 ender pearls*) to avoid ambiguity.
- Mix tasks that encourage sabotage with those that reward cooperation.
- Keep descriptions concise—the GUI shows the entire text to players.
